merge sorting
- divide in half until you have subarrays of length 1
- merge sorted lists together
- two arrays of length 1 become one array of length 2
- compare the front of each subarrays until one of them is empty, then put everything left 
in other subarray to the end of the subarray

quick sorting
- choose a pivot
- move all elements less than the pivot to its LHS
- and then all elements greater than the pivot will be on its RHS
- repeat steps 1-3 until array sorted

- ie. for each element in the list, you are choosing a new 
pivot until each are sorted
